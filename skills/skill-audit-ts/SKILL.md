description: "For skills whose bundled scripts are TypeScript: audit, validate, security-scan, and improve Agent Skills (SKILL.md files) for any agent compliant with the agentskills.io spec — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, VS Code, and others. USE FOR: saving coding preferences; troubleshooting why instructions/skills/agents are ignored or not invoked; configuring applyTo patterns; defining tool restrictions; creating custom agent modes or specialized workflows; packaging domain knowledge; fixing YAML frontmatter syntax; auditing a skill on a machine without Python (e.g. Windows without a Python install). Also trigger when the user doesn't say \"skill\" — e.g., \"this prompt file isn't activating\", \"rewrite my SKILL.md\", \"why doesn't my agent pick up my custom command\", or \"audit my skills directory\". NOT for skills whose bundled scripts are Python — use skill-audit for that. NOT for running trigger-rate evals — use the native skill-creator skill for that."
compatibility: Works with any agent platform supporting the agentskills.io specification (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, VS Code). Requires Node.js 18.3+ (20+ recommended) and a one-time `npm ci` to resolve tsx/typescript/vitest. count_tokens.ts uses @anthropic-ai/sdk if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, else a heuristic. All scripts are offline static analysis — no agent CLI required. Scripts run via `npx tsx`.

# Skill Optimizer (TypeScript)

Audit and improve an existing skill: validate it against the spec, find content anti-patterns, security-scan it, audit its bundled scripts, and sharpen its description against its siblings.

Out of scope: measuring how reliably a description triggers by running live prompts through an agent CLI. Hand that to the native `skill-creator` skill, then come back here to re-validate whatever it changed.

## Setup

**Resolve `${SKILL_DIR}` before running anything.** Every command below writes `${SKILL_DIR}` for this skill's own directory. It is notation, not a shell variable — no platform exports it. Substitute the absolute path yourself:

- **Claude Code** — the path is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`. That token is expanded when the skill loads, so it should already read as a real absolute path; use it verbatim.
- **Other platforms** — use the base directory this skill was loaded from.

Then, one time per install, substituting that path for `<SKILL_DIR>`:

```bash
cd "<SKILL_DIR>" && npm ci
```

This resolves `tsx`, `typescript`, and `vitest` from the committed `package-lock.json`. Every workflow step below invokes scripts via `npx tsx`, which resolves against this local install.

## Workflow

1. **Run static validators.** Delegate to a subagent to keep raw output out of the main context.

> **Subagent prompt:** Run the following three commands against `<skill-dir>` and return a single summary listing only FAIL and WARN items with their codes, messages, and affected files. Omit PASS items. Include the token count at the end.
>
> ```bash
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_skill.ts" <skill-dir> --json
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_skill.ts" <skill-dir> --json
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/count_tokens.ts" <skill-dir>/SKILL.md --json
> ```
>
> Substitute the resolved `${SKILL_DIR}` path (see Setup) into each command — the subagent cannot resolve it. If all pass with no warnings, return "All validators pass. Token count: N".

Interpreting codes (if reviewing results yourself):

- `validate_skill.ts` — spec enforcement: required fields, name regex, description length (1–1024), directory match, broken file references. Codes: `validate.<surface>.<concern>`.
- `analyze_skill.ts` — content anti-patterns: declarative openings, missing trigger contexts, body over 500 lines / 5000 tokens, generic filler, unguarded references. Codes: `analyze.<surface>.<concern>`.
- `count_tokens.ts` — exact count (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, if installed and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set) or calibrated heuristic (`len(text) / 3.5`). Returns `exact: false` on heuristic; treat as ±20%.

`validate_skill.ts`, `analyze_skill.ts`, `audit_security.ts`, `validate_agent_tool.ts`, and `detect_skill_overlap.ts` accept `--exit-on-warn` to treat findings as failures (CI / pre-commit); without it they exit 0 and you read the payload. `count_tokens.ts`, `perf_check.ts`, and `recommend_scripts.ts` do not — they emit no warnings.

2. **Optimize the description.** Read [references/description-guide.md](references/description-guide.md) when:

- The skill isn't activating
- Description is under ~150 characters or starts with "This skill..."
- You're about to revise the description

Whenever you touch the description, check it against its siblings — a description is only as good as its separation from the skills it competes with. Delegate to a subagent; overlap detection produces O(n²) pair output for large skill directories.

> **Subagent prompt:** Run overlap detection and return only pairs above the threshold. For each flagged pair, include the `shared_keywords` list and cosine score. If any pair scores ≥ 0.5, read [references/cross-skill-design.md](references/cross-skill-design.md) and include the recommended disambiguation strategy for that pair. If no pairs exceed the threshold, return "No overlap detected."
>
> ```bash
> # single skill against its siblings
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect_skill_overlap.ts" <skill-dir> \
>   --against ~/.claude/skills/ --json
>
> # or an all-pairs scan of a skills directory
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect_skill_overlap.ts" ~/.claude/skills/ --json
> ```

Read [references/cross-skill-design.md](references/cross-skill-design.md) when the script flags a pair above the threshold or the wrong skill activated for a request. Re-run detection after the description changes, to confirm you haven't created a new collision.

3. **Optimize the body.** Read [references/content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md), then apply in order:

- Cut what the agent already knows
- Convert declarations into procedures
- Add Gotchas for non-obvious environment facts
- Provide defaults, not menus
- Match prescriptiveness to fragility
- Bundle scripts for repeated logic
- Apply progressive disclosure (detail into `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`)

4. **Audit bundled scripts.** Delegate to a subagent — this step iterates over every script and produces verbose per-file output.

> **Subagent prompt:** Audit all bundled scripts in `<skill-dir>`. Run these three steps and return only material findings (FAIL or WARN) with the affected file, line number, and code. Omit clean passes.
>
> **4a. What should become a script:**
>
> ```bash
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/recommend_scripts.ts" <skill-dir> --json
> ```
>
> **4b. Per-script contract compliance:**
>
> ```bash
> for s in <skill-dir>/scripts/*.ts; do
>   npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_agent_tool.ts" "$s" --format json
> done
> ```
>
> **4c. Implementation quality:**
>
> ```bash
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/perf_check.ts" <skill-dir>/scripts/ --format json
> ```
>
> If a finding references a perf pattern, read [references/perf-findings.md](references/perf-findings.md) and include the recommended fix in your summary. Return results grouped by file.

5. **Security audit (OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10).** Delegate to a subagent when combined with steps 1 and 4.

> **Subagent prompt:** Run the security scanner on `<skill-dir>` and return all FAIL and WARN findings with their AST codes, affected locations, and recommended fixes. If any findings are flagged, read [references/security.md](references/security.md) and include the relevant rationale from the pre-publication checklist.
>
> ```bash
> npx tsx "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/audit_security.ts" <skill-dir> --json
> ```
>
> If clean, return "Security audit: no findings."

Findings carry an `AST##` id. Codes: `security.<surface>.<concern>`. Key checks:

- `security.tools.unrestricted-bash` / `security.tools.broad-bash-glob` (AST03)
- `security.secret.hardcoded` (AST04, **FAIL**)
- `security.script.unsafe-deserialization` (AST05)
- `security.script.shell-injection` / `security.script.dangerous-fs` (AST06)
- `security.exec.curl-pipe-shell` / `security.deps.unpinned` (AST02)
- `security.body.hidden-unicode` (AST01)

Read [references/security.md](references/security.md) for rationale behind each code and the pre-publication checklist.

6. **Re-validate.** Delegate to the same subagent pattern as step 1. Iterate until: `validate_skill.ts` passes, `analyze_skill.ts` warnings are addressed or consciously accepted, `audit_security.ts` shows no FAIL findings, and script audits report nothing material.

> **Combined audit subagent:** Steps 1, 4, 5, and 6 can be merged into a single subagent invocation when running a full audit. Prompt the subagent to run all validators, script audits, and security checks, then return one unified findings report grouped by severity (FAIL → WARN → INFO).

7. **Forward-test complex skills.** After substantial revisions or for tricky skills, launch a subagent to stress-test the skill on realistic tasks.

Forward-testing rules:

- The subagent should NOT know it's testing a skill. Prompt it as a real user would: `"Use <skill-name> at /path/to/skill to solve <problem>"` — not `"Review the skill at /path/to/skill and pretend a user asks…"`.
- Pass the artifact under validation (a file, a task description), not your diagnosis of what's wrong.
- Keep the prompt generic enough that success depends on transferable reasoning, not leaked ground truth.

Decision rule: err on the side of forward-testing. Skip only when the skill is trivial or the change is cosmetic. Ask for approval if forward-testing would take a long time, require additional user approvals, or modify live systems.

## Gotchas

- A command that runs as `npx tsx "/scripts/<name>.ts"` — leading slash, no skill path — means `${SKILL_DIR}` went through unsubstituted. Node reports `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `file:///scripts/...`. Re-read Setup; don't retry the command verbatim.
- Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings, `2` bad invocation, `3` nothing matched. A `2` means the path or flags were wrong, not that the skill failed validation.
- `audit_security.ts` blanks TypeScript strings, template literals, and comments (via the TypeScript compiler's scanner) before scanning (so `eval(` in a comment isn't a hit) and skips `tests/`, `node_modules/`, and `*.test.ts` files. A WARN is a prompt for a conscious decision, not an automatic defect.
- `count_tokens.ts` heuristic counts are ±20% — fine for "over budget?" decisions, not for fine-grained arithmetic.
- The `name` field MUST equal the parent directory name or `validate_skill.ts` reports `validate.name.dir-mismatch`.
- A fresh clone without `node_modules/` fails to resolve `tsx` — run the Setup `npm ci` first.
- `detect_skill_overlap.ts` flags pairs above a threshold; it doesn't prove a misfire. Use the `shared_keywords` field as the actionable signal — three or more shared domain keywords is real overlap.
- Two skills with bag-of-words cosine ≥ 0.5 and no explicit "NOT for X — see Y" disambiguator are a problem.

## Anti-patterns to flag immediately

- `description: Helps with PDFs.` — too short, no trigger contexts.
- `description: This skill processes CSVs.` — declarative; rewrite imperative.
- 800-line `SKILL.md` with embedded reference tables — split via progressive disclosure.
- Mega-skill bundling unrelated workflows — one skill, one job.
- Generic filler (`follow best practices`, `handle errors appropriately`) — replace with concrete gotchas.
- Reference files mentioned without a load trigger ("see references/ for details") — agent won't load them.
- `name`: uppercase, leading/trailing hyphen, consecutive hyphens, or mismatch with directory.
- Bundled scripts that hardcode secrets or `cd` into absolute paths outside the skill (AST04).
- Over-privileged `allowed-tools` — bare `Bash` or `Bash(*)` instead of a scoped prefix (AST03).
- `curl … | sh` or unpinned `package.json` dependencies (`^`, `~`, `*`, `git:`, `latest` instead of an exact version) (AST02).
- Unsafe dynamic evaluation — `eval()`, `new Function(...)`, `vm.runInThisContext`/`runInNewContext`, `child_process.exec(..., {shell: true})` (AST05/AST06).
- Scripts without `parseArgs`/`commander` or that print free-form text only.
- Scripts that echo SKILL.md content without sanitization.
- A `package.json` with no committed `package-lock.json` — `npm ci` won't resolve reproducibly.

## Platform notes

Scripts work on macOS, Linux, and Windows (Node.js 18.3+, 20+ recommended). `npx tsx` resolves and runs `.ts` files directly — no separate build step, and no `python`/`py -3` distinction to worry about on Windows. All file I/O is explicit UTF-8 via Node's `node:fs`; path handling goes through `node:path` so separators are normalized automatically.

All CLI scripts accept `--format json|text` (default `text`) and `--json` as a shorthand alias. Pass `--quiet` to suppress informational stderr (errors still print). Library modules (e.g. `skill_lib.ts`, `test-helpers.ts`) are marked `// agent-tool: false` and skipped by `validate_agent_tool.ts`.

## Specification quick reference

**Base spec** (`name`, `description` required; optional: `license`, `compatibility` ≤500 chars, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`).

**Platform extensions** (all optional):

- **Claude Code**: `when_to_use`, `argument-hint`, `arguments`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `model`, `effort`, `context`, `agent`, `hooks`, `paths`, `shell`.
- **GitHub Copilot / VS Code**: `description` and `mode` are the primary fields.
- **Codex**: follows the base spec; platform-specific extensions TBD.
