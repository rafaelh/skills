  completeness, predictable exit codes, and per-call performance matter. Trigger without the words
  "agent tool" — "write me a script to query the database", "build a CLI for this API", "this agent
  script feels slow". AUDIT mode: when the user asks you to review, critique, check, or trim an
  existing agent-callable script — "review this tool", "is this script agent-friendly", "check my
  CLI against best practices", "this tool has too many flags", "trim this down", "why does the
  agent keep calling this twice". Also trigger on scripts returning unstructured output, using
  interactive prompts, requiring multiple invocations, or showing perf anti-patterns (O(n²) string

# Agent Tool Builder

Build Python scripts that agents can call reliably in a single turn. The core constraint: an agent
cannot interactively query a script — it must express exactly what it needs via flags on one
invocation, and the script must return structured, parseable output with a meaningful exit code.

The bar: a good tool needs almost no documentation to use. It follows the standard interface, so the
agent already knows the flags; its output is concise and structured; and when it exits unexpectedly
it says why and what to try next. Guidance the tool carries itself costs nothing until it's needed —
the same guidance written into a SKILL.md is paid for on every load.

This skill operates in two modes. Identify which mode applies, then follow that mode's workflow
exclusively.

## Mode selection

| Mode      | Use when the user wants to…                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Build** | Write a new agent tool, scaffold a CLI, or add agent-callable behaviour (machine-readable output, exit codes, flag-based control) to an existing script |
| **Audit** | Review, critique, or trim an existing tool — check it against the contract, find flaws, or cut surface that has accreted |

"Improve this script so the agent can use it" is Build if the script is not yet agent-callable,
Audit if it already is; when genuinely unclear, ask. If the request spans both ("audit this and fix
what you find"), run Audit first, then fix. The **interface contract** (Build step 2), **Gotchas**,
and **Anti-patterns** sections are shared — both modes use them.

---

## Mode 1 — Build

### 1. Pin down the design decisions

Before writing code, run a decision-forcing interview. Most tools that need a rewrite a few hours
later fail because this step was hand-waved.

Enumerate the unresolved decisions below before asking anything, order them by dependency (data
model → operations → flag set → JSON shape), and ask one at a time with your recommended answer and
a one-line rationale — the user reviews a recommendation rather than redoing the analysis. Re-scan
for new branches after each answer. Stop when every decision below has an explicit answer.

**Canonical decisions for an agent tool:**

1. **What does the tool operate on?** (files, DB, HTTP API, local state, queue)
2. **What are the discrete operations?** One script per operation is usually cleaner than one
  mega-script with `--mode`. Confirm whether to split.
3. **What's the natural identifier?** UUID, slug, composite key? Is there a human-readable
  alternative the agent might prefer?
4. **What does a successful result look like?** Sketch the exact JSON shape — field names, nesting,
  types — and confirm one example payload.
5. **Is the operation destructive or stateful?** If yes, `--dry-run` is required; pin down what
  dry-run means precisely (does it hit the network?).
6. **What are the failure modes?** Map each to an exit code: bad input → 1, infrastructure → 2,
  not-found → 3. Confirm there isn't a fourth category.
7. **What's the expected result-set size?** Single record, bounded list, or unbounded? This
  determines whether `--limit` / `--cursor` are required.

**Answer these by reading code or docs, not by asking:** how the underlying API/DB paginates, what
field names exist, what auth is in place. Reserve the user's attention for choices only they can
make.

### 2. Apply the standard interface contract

Every agent tool must satisfy this interface. Read the full contract at
[references/interface-contract.md](references/interface-contract.md) when designing a new tool or
auditing an existing one.

**Mandatory flags:**

| Flag       | Behaviour                                                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--format` | `json` (default), `text`, or `csv` — agents should never need to ask for JSON explicitly |
| `--quiet`  | Suppress informational stderr; errors still emit                     |

**Conditional flags (add when relevant):**

| Flag                       | When required                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `--fields field1,field2`   | Any fetch/list operation with ≥4 returnable fields     |
| `--limit N` / `--offset N` | Any operation that may return multiple records         |
| `--cursor TOKEN`           | Prefer cursor over offset when the backend supports it |
| `--dry-run`                | Any create/update/delete/write operation               |

**Exit codes — non-negotiable:**

| Code | Meaning                                                                     |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | Success — data returned or operation completed                              |
| `1`  | User/invocation error — bad args, missing required flag, validation failed  |
| `2`  | System/infrastructure error — network failure, DB unreachable, file missing |
| `3`  | Not found / empty result — query succeeded but nothing matched              |

Exit code `3` is critical: it lets the agent distinguish "the thing doesn't exist" from "an error
occurred" without parsing output. Add `4` (permission denied) or `5` (conflict) only when the
agent's recovery path differs from `1`/`2`.

**Every non-zero exit explains itself** — including `3` — in the structured stderr line: what
happened, and what to do next. The caller should never need an exit-code table to act on the result.
If you find yourself writing one into a SKILL.md, the messages are too thin; see
[references/interface-contract.md](references/interface-contract.md).

**Output shapes.** Stdout carries clean JSON or nothing, so the agent can `json.loads()` it
unconditionally; errors go to stderr as their own JSON object. Always include `meta`, even empty —
it gives the agent a stable key. `data` may be an object for single-record operations, but the
shape must not change with result count.

```json
{"data": [...], "meta": {"count": 10, "total": 150, "next_cursor": "abc123"}}
```
```json
{"error": "Resource not found", "code": "NOT_FOUND", "hint": "List with: list-things --json"}
```

Optional error fields `"input"` (echo the failing arg) and `"transient": true` (retryable) help the
agent choose between retry and surface-to-user.

**Help text must include examples.** Use `argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter` and put 2–3
realistic invocations in `epilog`. `--help` is the agent's primary reference; flag lists without
examples leave it guessing.

### 3. Scaffold, then build test-first

**3a. Scaffold the boilerplate.** Run the bundled scaffolder rather than copying the template by
hand:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/init_tool.py" path/to/tool.py --name fetch_user --with-tests
```

This writes a fully-formed tool with `{{script_name}}` substituted, makes it executable, and (with
`--with-tests`) drops a paired subprocess test alongside. The scaffold provides the argparse
skeleton, exit-code constants, `_emit_error()`, and the `--format` / `--quiet` wiring. Skip this
step when modifying an existing script. (The underlying template lives at
`assets/templates/agent_tool.py.template` — `init_tool.py` reads it for you, no need to load it by
hand.)

**3b. Apply PEP 723 if the script is standalone.** Standalone means: any
`claude/skills/<name>/scripts/` file, or any one-off helper you might copy to another machine.

Read [references/pep723.md](references/pep723.md) for: shebang choice, `requires-python` and
`dependencies` rules, drift modes the validator catches.

**3c. Drive the implementation with TDD.** This skill delegates the red-green-refactor mechanics to
the [`tdd` skill](../tdd/SKILL.md) — load it if you're shaky on vertical-slice TDD or the
horizontal-slicing trap. Two agent-tool specifics layer on top:

1. **Test the CLI as a black box.** Drive every test via `subprocess.run` against the script.
  Patching internal functions like `fetch_record()` tests the adapter, not the CLI an agent will
  invoke.

   ```python
   def test_happy_path():
       r = subprocess.run([sys.executable, str(TOOL), "--id=42"], capture_output=True, text=True)
       assert r.returncode == 0, r.stderr
       payload = json.loads(r.stdout)
       assert payload["data"]["id"] == "42"
   ```

2. **The test agenda for an agent tool** — drive each as one vertical slice:

   1. Happy path → exit `0`, expected JSON shape on stdout
   2. Validation failure → exit `1`, structured error on stderr
   3. Not-found → exit `3`, no stdout, stderr names what was searched
   4. Field selection (if `--fields` is in scope) → output limited to keys
   5. Pagination (if multi-record per step 1.7) → correct slice + `meta.next_cursor`
   6. Dry-run (if destructive per step 1.5) → exit `0`, no side effects
   7. System error → exit `2`, structured error on stderr

   Drop entries whose gating condition didn't fire in step 1.

**Structural rules that govern every cycle:**

- **Validate all arguments before doing any work.** Check required flags, validate enums, resolve
  paths — then fail fast with exit `1`. Never start a network call or DB query before validation
  passes.
- **Separate pure logic from I/O.** Put the core operation in a function returning a dataclass or
  dict; keep all `print()` / `sys.exit()` in `main()`.
- **Never use `input()` or any interactive prompt.** If a required value is missing, exit `1` with
  a hint about which flag to add.
- **Make operations idempotent where possible.** A `create` that already exists should return the
  existing record with `"created": false`, not error.

### 4. Design for single-turn completeness

The agent cannot ask follow-up questions mid-script. Beyond the flags the contract already mandates,
confirm it can filter without a separate list call (`--filter key=value`), combine logical
conditions in one invocation, and pass every required identifier as a flag — no interactive ID
selection.

Read [references/single-turn-design.md](references/single-turn-design.md) when: the operation
naturally requires "first list, then act" (usually resolvable with a combined `--name` or
`--query` flag); you're tempted to add a `--mode` or `--action` flag (split instead); the output
shape varies significantly between invocations.

### 5. Validate the interface and check performance

Run both validators. For a single small tool, run them inline. For a suite, or when either produces
long output, delegate to one subagent so the raw per-file dumps stay out of the main context.

> **Subagent prompt:** Run these two commands against `<script-or-dir>` and return only FAIL, WARN,
> and HIGH/MEDIUM findings, each with file, line, code, and a one-line fix. Omit passes and LOW
> findings unless nothing else fired.
>
> ```bash
> python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_agent_tool.py" <script-path> --format json
> python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/perf_check.py" <script-or-dir> --format json
> ```
>
> If any perf finding needs interpretation, read
> [references/perf-findings.md](references/perf-findings.md) and include the recommended fix. If
> both are clean, return "Validators pass."

`validate_agent_tool.py` checks the contract mechanically: argparse present, `--format` / `--quiet`,
reachable exit codes `0/1/2/3`, no `input()`, stdout/stderr not mixed, PEP 723 block when non-stdlib
imports are detected, `epilog=` examples, structured error JSON on stderr.

`perf_check.py` accepts a file or a directory (walked recursively). Treat **HIGH** findings as
blockers. Read [references/perf-findings.md](references/perf-findings.md) when deciding whether a
flagged pattern matters in this specific tool, or when running the runtime profiler against a slow
script.

### 6. Justify anything the design didn't call for

If implementation surfaced a flag that wasn't in the step-1 decisions, it needs a justification,
not just a plausible use. Read [references/minimization.md](references/minimization.md) and apply
the removal heuristics before it ships — the cheapest surface to cut is surface never added.

---

## Mode 2 — Audit

Assess an existing agent tool from three independent angles, then reconcile. The reviews run as
parallel subagents: they produce verbose output, they must not anchor on each other, and only their
findings need reach the main context.

### 1. Build a context brief

Do this yourself before dispatching — the reviewers are far less useful guessing at it. One short
paragraph covering: what the tool does and operates on; who invokes it (agent, human, CI, or a mix);
where it is actually called from (grep the script name across the repo, sibling skills, and `.md`
docs, and note real call sites); and whether it is published anywhere that makes removals breaking.

### 2. Dispatch three reviewers in parallel

Read [references/audit-reviewers.md](references/audit-reviewers.md) now — it holds the three
ready-to-dispatch subagent prompts. Fill in the tool path and your context brief, then launch all
three in one batch:

- **A — contract audit.** Runs both validators, reads the contract and perf references, then
  hand-checks what the scripts cannot verify.
- **B — unconstrained review.** No checklist, no references. Reviews as a critical engineer: bugs,
  design flaws, anything a linter never catches.
- **C — minimization.** Follows [references/minimization.md](references/minimization.md) when
  inventorying the tool's surface, hunting for what never earned its keep. Proposes only cuts.

### 3. Reconcile

Merge the three reports yourself. Order matters:

1. **Deduplicate.** A finding raised by two reviewers is stronger, not two findings. Note the
  corroboration.
2. **Resolve the built-in conflict.** Reviewer B proposes additions; Reviewer C proposes cuts. Where
  they collide — B wants a flag, C flags that area as accreting — **default to not adding.** An
  addition ships only if it removes a round-trip the agent currently has to make, fixes a
  correctness bug, or the user asks for it. "Would be nice to have" loses to "keeps `--help`
  readable". This default is the whole reason C exists; do not quietly override it because B's
  argument reads well.
3. **Rank by cost to the caller.** A broken JSON shape or an unreachable exit `3` costs the agent
  every call. A LOW perf finding costs nothing. Sort accordingly, not by severity label.

### 4. Report, apply, re-validate

Present the reconciled findings grouped as **Blockers** (contract violations, correctness bugs,
HIGH perf), **Improvements**, and **Removals**, noting which reviewer raised each and whether it was
corroborated.

Apply blockers and approved improvements. Do not apply removals unilaterally — deleting a flag
someone relies on is a breaking change the user should sign off on, even when the evidence looks
conclusive.

Re-run Reviewer A's two commands after changes land: fixes to one contract rule routinely break
another — cutting a flag can orphan an `epilog` example, restructuring output can make exit `3`
unreachable.

### Gotchas (Audit)

- **Don't hand the reviewers each other's output.** Running them sequentially collapses three lenses
  into one — the second confirms the first instead of seeing past it.
- **A clean validator run is not a clean tool.** `validate_agent_tool.py` checks structure, not
  judgment: it can't tell that a flag is useless or that the tool needs two calls to do one thing.
  Reviewers B and C exist for exactly that gap — don't skip them when A comes back green.
- **Human-facing surface is not dead surface.** `--format text`, colour output, and profiling modes
  serve the maintainer. If a report proposes cutting one, check whether it mistook audience for
  disuse.
- **Findings are not automatically a rewrite.** Three MEDIUM findings on a stable call surface want
  three fixes, not a regeneration from the scaffolder.

---

## Gotchas (both modes)

- **Don't skip the decision-forcing interview.** "We'll just have it return the records" is "we'll
  figure it out later" — those decisions still exist, and resurface as bugs, awkward flag retrofits,
  or whole-script rewrites.
- **Stdout must be clean JSON or empty.** A startup message, progress spinner, or "done!" line on
  stdout breaks the agent's `json.loads()`. Route informational output to stderr, gated on
  `--quiet`.
- **Exit code `3` is not optional.** Without it, the agent cannot distinguish "not found" from
  "error" without parsing output, and will retry or assume failure.
- **`--format text` is for humans, not agents.** It exists for developers reading local output.
  Agents always use JSON (the default). Don't put logic in the text formatter that's absent from
  JSON.
- **Argparse `required=True` exits `2`, not `1`.** If you want exit `1` for missing args (it's a
  user error, not a system error), override `ArgumentParser.error()` or validate manually after
  `parse_args()`.
- **Dry-run is not the same as offline.** If your `--dry-run` path makes any network calls to check
  state, document this clearly in `--help`.
- **`--fields` filtering should happen before serialisation.** Fetching the full record then
  dropping keys wastes bandwidth. Pass through to the underlying API/query when the backend supports
  field selection.
- **Cursor tokens are opaque.** Pass them verbatim in `meta.next_cursor`.
- **Catch all exceptions at `main()`.** An unhandled traceback on stderr is confusing to the agent.
  Emit structured `{"error", "code", "hint"}` JSON and exit `2`.
- **Per-call overhead compounds.** Compile regexes at module scope, build output structures and
  serialise once (`out += json.dumps(r)` in a loop is O(n²)), and use set literals for membership
  tests. `perf_check.py` flags all three; read
  [references/perf-findings.md](references/perf-findings.md) when you need the rationale or the
  severity policy.
- **Keep units consistent across a tool suite.** Pick one timestamp format (ISO-8601), one duration
  unit (seconds), one size unit (bytes), and write the convention into the suite's `_common.py`.
  Mixing ISO-8601 in one tool and Unix epoch in another forces the agent to branch on
  representation.
- **For destructive ops adapted from human-facing CLIs, add `--yes` AND detect non-TTY.** Both are
  non-negotiable: a `--yes`/`--force` flag, plus a `sys.stdin.isatty()` check that auto-bypasses
  prompts when stdin isn't a terminal. Without the TTY check, an unflagged subprocess invocation
  hangs forever — the worst failure mode for an agent. Greenfield agent tools should just not have
  prompts (per the "no `input()`" rule).

## Anti-patterns to flag (both modes)

Every Gotcha above is also a scan target. These are the ones with no gotcha of their own:

- `argparse` with no `--format` flag — agents have no way to request structured output
- A single script with `--action create|update|delete` — split into separate scripts
- `input()` or `getpass()` anywhere in the call path
- Hardcoded page size with no `--limit`
- Returning different JSON shapes by result count (object vs array) — agent parsing breaks
- A script requiring two sequential calls for one logical operation
- `argparse.ArgumentParser` without `epilog=` examples — the validator flags this
- Writing every test up front then writing the script (horizontal slicing — see the `tdd` skill)
- Mocking internal functions instead of running the script as a subprocess
- A confirmation prompt without `--yes` AND without `sys.stdin.isatty()` — silent hang
- Accreted surface: flags reimplementing shell primitives (`--sort-by`, `--head`, `--grep` on JSON
  the agent could pipe to `jq`), tuning knobs no call site has ever set (`--timeout`, `--retries`),
  both halves of one axis (`--verbose` alongside `--quiet`), escape hatches that bypass the tool's
  own interface (`--raw`, `--extra-args`), or a `--help` long enough that choosing an invocation
  takes two readings. Read [references/minimization.md](references/minimization.md) before adding
  one more flag, or when auditing what is already there.

## Worked examples

Read [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) when you want a side-by-side good/bad
comparison to audit against, when a user asks *why* a rule matters and code lands the point faster
than prose, or when you need to confirm the shape of the happy-path output, validation block, JSONL
streaming, or stderr-logging idiom.
