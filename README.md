This repo contains agent skills that I use on a day to day basis outside of standard repo skills. They all comply with (and to some extent enforce) the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/) specification.

Most of these tools use python scripts, though there are some that use typescript.

## Skills

<details>
  <summary>skill-audit</summary>

### skill-audit
Audits, optimizes, validates, and trigger-evals Claude Agent Skills (SKILL.md files).

**Validation and analysis**
- Validates SKILL.md frontmatter, body structure, & script references against the spec
- Analyzes token budget, section balance, progressive disclosure quality, & gotchas coverage
- Recommends whether to introduce helper scripts, and what patterns they should follow
- Detects description overlap between sibling skills (bag-of-words cosine similarity)

**Description optimization**
- Rewrites the `description` field with imperative phrasing and concrete trigger contexts
- Runs a trigger-rate eval: invokes `claude -p` against a labeled query set and counts how often the skill activates
- Iterates candidate descriptions against train failures, scores against a held-out validation set, and proposes the winner

**Script quality** *(Python only)*
- Checks helper scripts for performance anti-patterns (AST static analysis + optional cProfile runtime profiling)
- Validates the agent-tool interface contract: `--format`, `--quiet`, `--dry-run` flags; exit codes `0/1/2/3`; no `input()`, no free-form stdout errors
- Counts tokens via the Anthropic SDK when available, heuristic fallback otherwise

**Security**
- Audits a skill against the [OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/): over-privileged `allowed-tools`, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, shell injection, supply-chain (fetch-and-run, unpinned deps), hidden-unicode instructions, and prompt injection in prose (instruction-override, replacement system prompts, concealment from the user, exfiltration of credentials). No guarantee it'll work, but better than nothing!
- Security checks cover SKILL.md and reference files regardless of language; Python-specific checks (unsafe deserialization, shell injection, dependency pinning) apply only to `.py` scripts

Scripts live in `skills/skill-audit/scripts/` and accept `--json` for machine-readable output.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validate_skill.py` | Frontmatter + body validation, exit 1 on any failure |
| `analyze_skill.py` | Token count, section balance, progressive disclosure quality |
| `recommend_scripts.py` | Advises on helper scripts — what to add and what patterns to follow |
| `detect_skill_overlap.py` | Cosine similarity between skill descriptions; single-skill or all-pairs mode |
| `eval_triggers.py` | Trigger-rate eval against a labeled query set; train/validation split |
| `optimize_description.py` | Multi-round description optimizer; propose-only by default, `--apply` to write |
| `count_tokens.py` | Token counter; exact via Anthropic SDK, heuristic fallback |
| `perf_check.py` | AST-based performance checker + optional cProfile profiling |
| `audit_security.py` | OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 audit; FAILs on hardcoded secrets, WARNs on the rest |

  <summary>skill-audit-ts</summary>

### skill-audit-ts

The TypeScript twin of `skill-audit` — same audit/eval workflow, for skills whose bundled scripts are TypeScript (run via `npx tsx`) instead of Python. For teams without Python available, most commonly Windows machines.

**Validation, analysis, and description optimization** — same feature set as `skill-audit` above, retargeted at TypeScript.

**Script quality** *(TypeScript only)* — `validate_agent_tool.ts` and `perf_check.ts` are folded directly into this skill (no dependency on `agent-tool-builder`, which is Python-only). Performance checks target JS/TS anti-patterns: string `+=` in a loop, `new RegExp(literal)` recompiled per iteration, array `.includes()`/`.indexOf()` membership tests, `readFileSync` in a loop, `.sort()`/`.reverse()` in a loop.

**Security** — same OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 coverage, with the script-construct checks retargeted: `eval()`/`new Function()`/`vm.runInThisContext` (unsafe deserialization), `child_process.exec`/`{shell: true}` (shell injection), `fs.rmSync(..., {recursive: true})` (dangerous fs), and `package.json` dependency pinning (supply chain) in place of PEP 723 checks.

Scripts live in `skills/skill-audit-ts/scripts/` and accept `--format json|text` for machine-readable output.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validate_skill.ts` | Frontmatter + body validation, exit 1 on any failure |
| `analyze_skill.ts` | Token count, section balance, progressive disclosure quality |
| `recommend_scripts.ts` | Advises on helper scripts — what to add and what patterns to follow |
| `detect_skill_overlap.ts` | Cosine similarity between skill descriptions; single-skill or all-pairs mode |
| `eval_triggers.ts` | Trigger-rate eval against a labeled query set; train/validation split |
| `optimize_description.ts` | Multi-round description optimizer; propose-only by default, `--apply` to write |
| `count_tokens.ts` | Token counter; exact via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (optional dep), heuristic fallback |
| `perf_check.ts` | AST-based (TypeScript compiler API) performance checker, static only |
| `audit_security.ts` | OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 audit; FAILs on hardcoded secrets, WARNs on the rest |
| `validate_agent_tool.ts` | Interface contract validation — flags, exit codes, output shape (folded in from agent-tool-builder) |

  <summary>agent-tool-builder</summary>

### agent-tool-builder

Builds and reviews **Python** scripts intended to be called by AI agents as tools. Enforces a standard interface contract (structured JSON output, predictable exit codes, `--format`, `--quiet`, `--dry-run`) and catches performance anti-patterns before they cost agent round-trips.

> If your agent tools are written in TypeScript, Bash, or another language, this skill's validation and scaffolding won't apply. You'd need a separate contract enforcer for that language's conventions.

**Design interview**

- Runs a decision-forcing interview to pin down the tool's data model, operations, flag set, JSON output shape, and failure modes before writing a line of code

**Interface contract enforcement**

- Validates mandatory flags (`--format`, `--quiet`), conditional flags (`--dry-run`, `--limit`, `--cursor`), exit code conventions, and stderr discipline
- Ensures output is parseable JSON by default — agents should never need to parse human-readable text

**Scaffolding**

- Scaffolds new agent tools from a PEP 723 template with argparse, `--format json/text/csv`, structured error output, and stub tests

**Performance auditing**

- Detects O(n²) string concatenation, recompiled regexes, and list-membership anti-patterns via AST analysis + optional cProfile profiling

Scripts live in `skills/agent-tool-builder/scripts/` and accept `--json` for machine-readable output.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validate_agent_tool.py` | Interface contract validation — flags, exit codes, output shape |
| `perf_check.py` | AST-based performance checker + optional cProfile profiling |
| `init_tool.py` | Scaffold a new agent tool from the bundled PEP 723 template |

  <summary>create-agents-for-repo</summary>

### create-agents-for-repo
This skill adds custom agents to the repository it is run on, and where appropriate wires them into the repo's skills and `CLAUDE.md` so that they run. This keeps verbose output out of the main context window and assigns work to cheaper models where possible. It requires Python `>=3.14` to run its integrated scripts, but will work regardless of the language of the target repo.

Don't run `/create-agents-for-repo` in this repo. The skills here are intended to be portable and travel between repos; the subagents this writes don't. The subagents are tailored to the target repo, hardcoding the local toolchain (what linters to run, which trees hold specific, etc), so they don't travel well.

**What it looks for**
- Work a cheaper model does correctly because something external — an exit code, a schema, a diff — decides whether it succeeded
- Work that needs judgment but produces bulky, disposable evidence the main context shouldn't keep
- Existing agents that are miscast, unrestricted, or that nothing ever invokes

**What it writes**
- `.claude/agents/*.md` with a narrowed tool grant, an explicit model, and a return contract that caps what comes back
- A `## Delegation` routing table in CLAUDE.md — the durable backbone, since it survives skill re-imports
- Call sites inside repo-local SKILL.md workflows, skipped for plugin-installed or symlinked skills where an edit would be reverted or would leak upstream

**How it runs**

The candidate hunt and the review of that hunt are themselves delegated to parallel subagents — reading whole skill bodies and measuring how much each command prints is exactly the bulky, disposable work the skill tells everyone else to hand off. The reviewer is adversarial and separate from the hunters, and asks two questions of every candidate: would a subagent actually be *good* at this, and is it cheaper than the simplest thing that would work? A `-q` flag, a pre-commit hook, a Makefile target, or the built-in `Explore` agent all beat a bespoke agent when they suffice, and "SIMPLER: add `-q`" is a legitimate verdict.

It then proposes the whole batch and stops for approval before writing anything, lists the candidates it rejected so the bar is visible, and asks separately about Opus agents — those buy context isolation but no cost saving, so it's your call.

  <summary>architecture, plan, tdd, refactor</summary>

## These skills are designed to be used together
The `architecture` and `tdd` skills have been adapted for my needs from Matt Pocock's [Skills for Agents](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), check his repo out, it's awesome. The refactor skill is adapted from Addy Osmani's [Agent Skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills), also good to review.

They assume you are working in a python codebase - you'll need to update them for anything else. They also assume you are using: `pyright` for type safety, `pytest` for testing, and `ruff` for linting/sast/etc. These are all pretty solid choices.

The cycle for use should be:

1. After running `/init` on a repo, use `/architecture` write ADRs, create `CONTEXT-MAP.md`
2. `/plan` create a plan for a feature (with a smart model like Opus)
3. `/tdd` test driven development, for building stuff (with a workhorse model like Sonnet)
4. `/refactor` to simplify and refactor the work that has been done
5. Optionally, `/architecture` to review an existing codebase for ADR violations, or look for deepening opportunities.

## Installing
<details>
  <summary>Install Details</summary>
### Option 1
Use a recent version of the **GitHub CLI** and run `gh skill install rafaelh/skills <skillname>`. This will copy the skill into your target repo, or global directory (you'll be prompted for your choice). At a later date running `gh skill update rafaelh/skills <skillname>` will pull an updated version of this skill.

### Option 2
This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. From inside Claude Code, add the marketplace and install whichever skills you need:

```
/plugin marketplace add rafaelh/skills
/plugin install skill-audit@rafaelh
/plugin install skill-audit-ts@rafaelh
/plugin install agent-tool-builder@rafaelh
/plugin install architecture@rafaelh
/plugin install plan@rafaelh
/plugin install tdd@rafaelh
/plugin install refactor@rafaelh
/reload-plugins
```

Once installed, skills activate automatically based on context — `skill-audit` or `skill-audit-ts` when you ask Claude to audit a SKILL.md (pick based on whether your bundled scripts are Python or TypeScript); `agent-tool-builder` when you ask Claude to write or improve a Python script an agent will call. `skill-audit` and `skill-audit-ts` cover overlapping ground by design — their descriptions each carry an explicit "NOT for X — see Y" disambiguator so only one activates per request.

After installing `skill-audit-ts`, run `npm ci` once inside `skills/skill-audit-ts/` to resolve `tsx`/`typescript`/`vitest` from the committed lockfile.

## Requirements

**skill-audit / agent-tool-builder (Python):**
- Python 3.14+ (all bundled scripts are stdlib-only except where PEP 723 metadata declares third-party deps)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment (optional — enables exact token counts via the SDK)

**skill-audit-ts (TypeScript):**
- Node.js 18.3+ (20+ recommended), plus a one-time `npm ci` in the skill directory
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment (optional — enables exact token counts via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`)

**Both:**
- Claude Code CLI (for trigger evals and description optimization)
